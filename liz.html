        <p id="write-out">The straight sex scene in the car was seriously nasty. Why would you have sex with your husband after he cheated on you? When there’s a hot woman who you could have sex with instead? Why is the straight sex scene the first one we see? If Eva was going to leave him, then why did they include that gross scene? Then, when Liz and Eva finally end up in bed together, they don’t even do anything past kissing! Of course the gay sex scene (if you can even call it that) shows nothing. I guess that Eva had sex with her husband in the car to get pregnant. Eva has a baby to name it after Liz? Why not just keep Liz alive? Dumb. That’s so random. Liz just has cancer and dies? Why do that? I have a BONE TO PICK with the writer and director. Fina Torres and Jane Chambers, what the fuck! Another sad lesbian movie. I feel like I just wasted almost 2 hours of my life that I will never get back. This is another movie with cheating. It’s annoying how frequently lesbians are depicted as being cheaters in movies. This movie had the worst plot. I was going to rate it 6/10, but the more I thought about it, and how bad it is, I’m lowering the rating.</p>
