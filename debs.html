        <p id="write-out">I really like the plot of this movie. The special effects were not great, but I will overlook that. At least they tried. I like the characters and the storyline.
           It is homophobic that everyone walked in on the sex scene with Amy and Lucy Diamond. Why did Lucy not have a lock on the door?
           They couldn’t have waited another day to find Amy? It had to be right when they were having sex. The lesbians can’t enjoy anything! </p>
