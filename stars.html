        <p id="write-out">This book is alright. It left me wanting more like I drank half of my iced coffee and left the other half in my car.
           I appreciate that there were a few sex scenes, although there was something that was off about them. The descriptions were a little weird. I’m not the biggest fan of the plot of this book.
           I feel like it’s too drawn out. I would recommend this book if you have a lot of free time. The characters are cool, but I’m not impressed. </p>
