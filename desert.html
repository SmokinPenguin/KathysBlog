        <p id="write-out">My first thought: pretty hot. The sex scene was good in my opinion because there were boobs. Joelle did not like that they didn’t have music and the sounds of them kissing was loud. Cay and Vivian argued so much, and Vivian’s intense fear of being pushed out of the closet was annoying. I wish the ending was a bit more substantial, but all in all, this was an enjoyable film to watch.</p>
