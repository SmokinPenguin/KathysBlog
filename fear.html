        <p id="write-out">“Fear Street” is a great movie trilogy. It kept me on my toes and was the perfect amount of scary.
           However, I wish the characters were older. They’re too young, in my opinion, to be put in sexual situations. It’s kinda creepy. Other than that, I really enjoyed these movies. </p>
