        <p id="write-out">The movie for me gets a 1/10. Especially Kate Winslet peeing on the beach. It was kinda gross. Also, they showed a dick for some reason.
          It seems like just to make lesbians uncomfortable. Skip past the first 30 minutes of the movie and thank me later. The sex scenes, however, get a 10/10 for me.
          Specifically the second one. Joelle said it lives rent free in her mind. The same goes for me. I actually didn’t watch the end of the movie because it seemed depressing and there’s no more sex.
           They don’t even end up together. What’s the point of that? </p>
