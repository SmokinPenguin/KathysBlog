        <p id="write-out">You’re telling me that they go to a fairy school and there’s no lesbians? Bullshit. I have one question: why was there not a female gay character?
          There is a male who is bi, but what about a lesbian or even a bi girl? This is homophobic.
          The special effects are pretty cool, and I like the acting. This review is from a lesbian point of view and has a lesbian disappointed. </p>
