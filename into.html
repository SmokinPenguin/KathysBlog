        <p id="write-out">This book is really cool. If you’ve read my other reviews, then you know what I’m going to say, but I wish it was more gay. I am rarely satisfied.
          The folklore and mermaid aspect is great in this book. It was an addictive read. I didn’t want to put this book down. It’s action packed and has likable characters.
           I would recommend this book to people who like horror novels. </p>
