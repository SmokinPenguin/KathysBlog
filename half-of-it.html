        <p id="write-out">It took me about 4 tries to watch this movie. It started out slow, and didn’t pick up any momentum. I felt like I was waiting and waiting for an ending that wasn’t that good.
          This movie is mediocre to me. However, the cinematography was super cool and the acting was good. My issues are plot based. </p>
